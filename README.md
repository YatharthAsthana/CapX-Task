# CapX-Task
Task Requirements:
1. Data Collection:
● Select one platform: Twitter, Reddit, or Telegram.
● Scrape relevant data from specific handles, subreddits, or Telegram channels
that discuss stock market trends, predictions, or individual stocks.
○ Example: Stock-specific Twitter hashtags, Reddit threads like
r/wallstreetbets, or Telegram groups discussing stock tips.
● Clean and preprocess the data to ensure quality and consistency (handle missing
values, remove noise, etc.).
2. Data Analysis & Feature Extraction:
● Perform sentiment analysis on the scraped data to gauge the overall mood
(positive/negative/neutral) related to specific stocks.
● Extract key features such as:
○ Sentiment polarity (e.g., whether the discussions around a stock are
generally positive or negative).
○ Frequency of mentions for specific stocks or market trends.
○ Topic modeling (Optional): Identify key discussion themes.
● Explore potential correlations between the features (sentiment, mentions) and
actual stock price movements over time.
